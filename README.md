# Python File Downloader

run this script in the command line to download files using links on as website

I run this script on a server to update the sitemaps that are auto gnenerated by a 3rd party site we use for sitemap generation

run script by inputting this in a CLI enviroment: **python file_downloader.py**
- script will ask for url of the page that you would like to download files from
- script will ask for file extension of files you would like to download
- script will download all files in bulk into the same directory the *file_downloader.py* is loacted in

**NOTE**
- downloads *ALL* files using the file extension you input. This program is really simple and it downloads everything with a file extension matching what the user inputs
